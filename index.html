						<p><strong>Edit: 15/07/2023 @ 21:10</strong> That's all folks. It was fun while it lasted! I can't support this physically and all content is gone as I have immediately cancelled my Workspaces account as soon as it hit read only an hour or so ago.</p>

<p>================</p>

<p>Recently news broke in the community that Google had cracked down on unlimited Google Drive.</p>

<p>I have received (daily) the following email. I am currently looking into alternatives, but if there is no route then we will downscale massively in terms of content. Physical media availability sits at around 4TB and Google Drive which we cache is at 52TB. There is no way I can buy this much physical hard drive space and most alternatives are way too expensive, charging for both data bad bandwidth.</p>

<p>Maybe the end of days?</p>

<p>"You’ve exceeded your pooled storage limit and your account has been placed in a 60 day grace period.</p>

<p>After the grace period ends on Jul 16, 2023, your account will go into a “read-only” state. In this state services will be impacted, including users not being able to upload new files or create new Google Docs, Sheets, Slides or Forms. <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/12002975#over_limit?utm_source=12243322&amp;utm_medium=email">Learn more</a> about the features that will be impacted in this state."</p>
