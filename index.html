						<p>Nationwide Virgin Media outage. Awaiting further updates.</p>

							<p>Connectivity back online however service may be intermittent.</p>

							<p><strong>Network Update</strong></p>

<p>"A technical conference call remains ongoing with representation from various data support teams and Vendor Juniper.Reports that serveral FPC cards within several Backbone routers across 4 sites (Manchester, Brentford, Birmingham &amp; Northampton) are dropping traffic from their assigned Aggregate links, approximately every 20-30 minutes. </p>

<p>Multiple FPC cards have been remotely reset. A Network Engineer onsite at Manchester was tasked to physically reseat the FPC cards in Manchester Backbone-3, as an attempt to stabilise the hardware. Network Engineer's have also been assigned to attend the other Backbone routers to investigate. ETA's are curretly being sought.</p>

<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>JTAC/Juniper to extract system logs from impacted devices- Network Engineer to reseat the FPC cards in Manchester Backbone 3- Support teams to provide next steps- LG Network team to further investigate the Arbor network monitoring tool- JTAC to feedback on suspected DDoS attack."</li>
</ul>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2023-04-04 11:08:00 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p><strong>Network Update</strong></p>

<p>We have received confirmation from Virgin Media that the issue has now been fully resolved and is under extended, close monitoring. We can confirm that all affected services have been stable since approximately 08:00 AM.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2023-04-04 15:47:34 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p><strong>Network Update</strong></p>

<p>We are seeing further impact on services affected this morning with additional services affected as well. Escalations have been raised into Virgin Media and Virgin Media engineers are investigating the outage. Further updates to follow.</p>

						
							<p><em>Update <span class="moment">2023-04-04 19:14:21 UTC</span></em></p>
							<p><strong>Update 7 (Apr 4, 2023 6:24 PM BST)</strong></p>

<p>FPC-2 at Brentford was successfully reset from 16:54, which restored connectivity for Aorta services via Brentford temporarily. FPC-3 at Brentford then went in to a 'wedged' state, shortly after FPC-2 was reset. FPC-3 at Brentford Backbone-3 was successfully reset from 17:26.</p>

<p>Juniper Engineers retrieved the recent log data from Northampton Backbone-3, before the affected FPC cards were reset.</p>

<p>Work to restore the routes via Manchester Backbone-3 is underway. The FPC card reporting errors is being remotely reset as a first step.</p>

<p>FPC-2 at Birmingham Backbone-3 also began to report issues at approximately 17:25. DINMC 2nd Line also reset this FPC card.</p>

<p>Utilization on FPC-3 at Leeds Backbone-3 was also noted to be rising from 17:57.</p>

<p>Following advice from Juniper, further DDoS Mitigation was applied at Brentford Backbone-3 from approximately 18:00. The remaining Backbone routers at Northampton, Birmingham, Manchester &amp; Leeds have also had the mitigation applied.</p>

<p>Impacted FPC's cards are being reset to stabilise the hardware pending further advice from Juniper.</p>

<p>The technical conference bridge remains ongoing.
Plan
- Support teams to reset impacted FPC's
- Juniper to provide next steps
- MIM conference bridge ongoing</p>
